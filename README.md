### S3 
- Create a s3 bucket with blocking public access
- Go to aws Identity and Access Management (IAM) -> create policy -> choose service s3 -> from read click on get object -> from write put object, delete object, etc
- From resource -> add arn -> specify bucket name -> object name check any
- next set a policy name and keep everything default
- Go to users -> create a user from application -> access key -> check programetic access
- In permission -> attach existing policy -> search name of the policy we made
- Add user and copy access key id and access key secret




### AWS certificate manager 
- Request a certificate -> enter domain (will get name and value for cname)- validate domain (by creating cname record we can validate)
- Create cname record from route 53 domain (if it is already created then just exit it) - > change cname and cname value according to aws ec2 certificate manager certificate - after validation we can see success message
- from ec2 instance - client load balencer (left panel) -> 

Create application load balancer
set  name - check all mapping zome (e.g: us-est-2b) - security group as same as ec2 instance group -> 
click on specific load balancer and edit http(80) -> remove default acction -> add redirect -> select https -> port number 443
Create target group - register a target

route 53
